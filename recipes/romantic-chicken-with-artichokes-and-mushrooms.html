            This Romantic Chicken with Artichokes and Mushrooms recipe is easy, flavorful, and aromatic. The combination of white wine, artichokes, and mushrooms make this chicken dish the perfect way to win over anyone's heart. The chicken is seasoned with salt and pepper and then browned in a large skillet with olive oil and butter. The artichokes and mushrooms are sautéed until tender, then the chicken is returned to the skillet along with the reserved artichoke liquid and white wine. The dish is simmered until the chicken is cooked through and then capers are stirred in for an added burst of flavor. Serve this dish with buttered noodles and fresh greens for a delicious and romantic meal.
